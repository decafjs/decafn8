DecafJS File Module
===================

The File module is one of many possible ways to interface to the filesystem from JavaScript.

This module emulates somewhat closely the java.io.File way of doing things, but adds methods
to read and write the files as well.

For a Posix or Unix file system interface, see the fs module.
